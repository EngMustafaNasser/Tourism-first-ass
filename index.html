            <td>The pyramids <p>The Pyramids of Cairo, also known as the Pyramids of Giza, are ancient structures built
                    during the Old Kingdom period of ancient Egypt, around 2580–2560 BC. Built as tombs for the
                    pharaohs, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the largest, standing about 146 metres (490 ft) tall. These
                    pyramids, which are precisely aligned with the cardinal points of the compass, are major tourist
                    attractions today, attracting millions of visitors each year. Next to the pyramids stands the Great
                    Sphinx of Giza, another symbol of ancient Egypt. Despite their age, efforts are ongoing to preserve
                    and protect these magnificent structures.</p>

            <td> Al-Azhar Mosque <p>For fans of Islamic architecture, Al-Azhar Mosque is a must-see. Founded by the
                    Fatimid Jawhar al-Siqilli in 970, it is now a stunning blend of different styles and periods. For
                    example, the qibla wall dates back to the 14th century, Sultan Qaytbay added a minaret in 1475, the
                    main façade dates back to the 19th century, and the double-arched portal dates back to the mid-18th
                    century. Visitors can enjoy the intermingling of Fatimid, Mamluk and Ottoman architectural features
                    in this magnificent building. It should be noted that the mosque and school complex at Al-Azhar is
                    one of the oldest universities in the world. Al-Azhar is distinguished by its unique architectural
                    style that reflects the history of Islamic art, and part of its uniqueness lies in the fact that it
                    was a center for Shiite theological studies until the 1260s, before reopening as a Sunni
                    institution. The mosque is named after Fatima al-Zahra, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, and is
                    a beacon for Islamic scholars around the world.</p>

            <td>Cairo Citadel or Saladin Citadel <p>A massive citadel in Islamic Cairo, the Citadel of Sultan Saladin
                    al-Ayyubi stands tall atop the Mokattam Hills. Originally built by Saladin in 1176 AD, it became the
                    official residence of Egypt’s rulers under Sultan al-Kamil ibn al-Adil in 1207 AD. Despite its
                    historical significance, the Citadel’s role as a seat of power shifted to Abdeen Palace in the 19th
                    century. Witnessing pivotal moments in Egyptian history, it now offers visitors a wealth of
                    attractions,
                    including the famous Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha and other notable sites such as the Mosque of
                    al-Nasir
                    Muhammad ibn Qalawun and the Mosque of Sulayman Pasha al-Khadem. It also houses several museums,
